## About
=========

Pxl Core is a plugin to provide backbone functions to any WordPress build. When building WordPress themes do you find yourself including the same pieces of code over and over again between sites. The aim of this plugin is to provide all this functionality simply by activating a plugin and setting a few plugin options to suite your needs.
